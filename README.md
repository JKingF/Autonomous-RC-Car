# Self-Driving RC-Car project  
ROS Software for performing autonomous driving using monocular vision on an RC car.  
These nodes provide two driving mode:  
- `manual`: The default mode. In this mode, you can drive the RC Car manually using the paired PS4 controller. You can also recording driving sequences to assemble new training data. Pressing L1, you can retrain a model from scratch using. 
- `autonomous`: The self-driving mode. This mode enables the trained residual network to perform steering and throttle inference from input images.
